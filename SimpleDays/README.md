# SimpleDays

A simple desktop message notification for [KDays](http://kdays.cn/), which is a proof-of-see-I-can-do-this-concept.

Since I don't go to this site that often, a lot of functions are missing. Also the private key and public key are invalid, so you cannot login (or use my keys XD).

This is a Chinese site, so basically all comments are in Chinese. Also I used some libraries from the Internet, so if you think this program is violating your copyright, please create an issue about it.

## Info

* Platform: Windows x86
* Language: Assembly
